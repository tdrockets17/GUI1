(for some reason not all the features work on gh pages however they work fine from the zip file. Not sure why.)

I believe everything is working as it should be. You simply drag the tile pieces to the board and if the word is validated then "word validated" buttong lights up green. If you cannot figure out a word you can reset the board. It keeps track of your score and the total tile pieces remaining. If you drag a piece onto an existing piece on the board, a prompt displays encouraging the user to put the piece on the correct spot on the board. If you don't drag a piece onto the board correctly, the current piece is redirected back onto the user's rack. All and all this was a fun assignment, but took much longer than I was anticipating.
